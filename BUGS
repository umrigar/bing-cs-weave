Errors are handled on the client-side; server-side error handling is
mainly to prevent non-official client submissions from causing problems.
Server side error handling leaves a bit to be desired.

  + No attempt is made to display server errors for error-causing
    widgets.  In fact, only the error is displayed without any
    other content.

  + All trapped server errors are reported as 400 BAD REQUEST.

Styling could use some work.
